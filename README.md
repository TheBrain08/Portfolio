### Project Planning

The project is developed using Bootstrap to ensure a responsive layout. The pages are structured and designed according to the programming languages and topics they cover.

### Detailed Planning

Each HTML page is described in detail using Markdown documents:

- [Home Page (index.html)](doc/index.md): Introduction to the portfolio and overview of its contents.
- [C Programming (pro-c.html)](doc/pro-c.md): Page dedicated to the C programming language.
- [C++ Programming (pro-cpp.html)](doc/pro-cpp.md): Page dedicated to the C++ programming language.
- [Python Programming (pro-python.html)](doc/pro-python.md): Page dedicated to the Python programming language.
- [Web Development (pro-web.html)](doc/pro-web.md): Page dedicated to web development topics.

### Frameworks

Bootstrap is used as the framework for layout and styling of the pages to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface.
